//! The cassette deck: playback signal generation and recording.
//!
//! This is a faithful port of Roman Borik's GPMD85 emulator tape
//! interface (`IifTapePMD85.cpp`, `IifTape.cpp`) for the IRPS/"V2"
//! interface used by the PMD 85-2/3 monitors:
//!
//! - The tape runs at a 1200 Hz bit clock; every *half-clock*
//!   (853 CPU cycles at 1× speed) the DSR line carries
//!   `tape_clock XOR data_bit`. Monitor 3 demodulates this bit-banged
//!   signal through the 8251 status register (port 0x1F, bit 7) —
//!   it even measures the leader frequency to time its sampling.
//! - One byte is framed as 2 half-clocks start bit, 16 half-clocks of
//!   data (LSB first, one bit per 2 half-clocks) and 4 half-clocks
//!   stop bit: 22 half-clocks in total.
//! - Blocks are introduced by leader tones: 2.8 s before a file
//!   header (plus a 1.5 s gap when continuing from a previous block),
//!   0.5 s before a body/continuation block, and 0.2 s of silence
//!   (steady DSR) after a body.
//! - Recording sniffs the bytes the CPU writes to the 8251
//!   transmitter: 16×`FF`, 16×`00`, 16×`55` announce a file header,
//!   followed by the 15 header bytes and a body of `wLength + 2`
//!   bytes. Further bytes within 0.2 s of each other continue as
//!   extra headerless blocks until 2 s of silence finalize the save.
//!
//! A `speed` multiplier fast-forwards the deck in both directions:
//! playback feeds the signal faster, and the ROM's save routine is
//! throttled proportionally less (at [`MAX_SPEED`] the transmitter is
//! never gated, making saves effectively instant). Playback above
//! ~8× relies on the monitor's adaptive clock recovery staying within
//! its polling granularity; MAX is best-effort.
//!
//! # Flash loading
//!
//! Body blocks can be *flash* blocks: instead of modulating the
//! signal, the data is served straight to the ROM's read loops, which
//! `machine.rs` intercepts at their entry points (a port of GPMD85's
//! flash load). While a flash block is being served the DSR carries a
//! continuous leader-tone carrier, so the ROM's edge-sensitive
//! readers keep waiting exactly as they would behind a real leader.
//! Header blocks always play for real (the ROM's leader
//! synchronization genuinely runs), with a shortened leader in flash
//! sessions. If nothing consumes a flash block for about a second —
//! a custom reader we cannot intercept — the deck falls back to
//! playing the remaining bytes for real.
